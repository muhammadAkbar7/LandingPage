# LandingPage

This is the Landing Page for my future portfolio website.

At the time, my landing page is complete (intial phase). When I acquire more skills and have more time, I plan 
to update the links and features on this website to showcase my new projects I've done. 

All photos were acquired from unSplash. 

I'm using HTML and CSS to build this page.
